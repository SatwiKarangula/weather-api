# Weather API Backend Application

## Project Overview

This project is a full backend REST API application developed using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, and OpenWeather API.

The application demonstrates real-world backend development concepts including:

* REST API development
* CRUD operations
* External API integration
* MongoDB Atlas database integration
* Request validation
* Error handling
* Logging
* Environment variable management
* Modular backend architecture

The backend fetches real-time weather information from the OpenWeather API, stores weather data inside MongoDB Atlas, and exposes multiple custom API endpoints to perform CRUD operations.

This project was developed as part of backend and DevOps learning to understand how modern backend services communicate with databases and third-party APIs.

---

# MongoDB Atlas Setup

## Step 1 — Create MongoDB Atlas Account

Visit:
https://www.mongodb.com/atlas

Create a free MongoDB Atlas account and create a free-tier cluster.

---

## Step 2 — Create Database User

Navigate to:

```text id="cxql0n"
Security → Database Access
```

Create a database user.

Example:

```text id="y7y4ng"
Username: satwik_db_user
Password: 123456
```

---

## Step 3 — Configure Network Access

Navigate to:

```text id="1x35e6"
Security → Network Access
```

Add:

```text id="ktw2em"
0.0.0.0/0
```

This allows access from all IP addresses during development.

---

## Step 4 — Get MongoDB Connection String

Navigate to:

```text id="8p6d2z"
Cluster → Connect → Drivers
```

Select:

* Node.js

Copy the generated connection string.
# If any Problem Faced in hosting the server — MongoDB SRV Connection Issue & Solution

While connecting MongoDB Atlas with the Node.js backend application, an SRV DNS connection issue was encountered during the database connection process.

## Error Faced

```text
querySrv ECONNREFUSED _mongodb._tcp.weather-api.vlnf710.mongodb.net
```

---

# Cause of the Issue

The issue occurred because the `mongodb+srv://` connection string uses DNS SRV record resolution internally.

Some networks, DNS configurations, college WiFi networks, antivirus software, or firewall settings may block SRV DNS lookups, which prevents Node.js and MongoDB Atlas from resolving the cluster address properly.

---

# Initial Connection String

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@weather-api.vlnf710.mongodb.net/
```

This resulted in the SRV connection failure.

---

# Solution Implemented

To resolve the issue, the standard MongoDB connection string (`mongodb://`) was used instead of the SRV-based connection string.

## Steps Followed

1. Opened MongoDB Atlas
2. Navigated to:

```text
Cluster → Connect → Drivers
```

3. Selected:

* Node.js Driver

4. Clicked:

```text
Show More Options
```

5. Selected:

```text
Standard Connection String
```

6. Replaced the SRV URI with the standard MongoDB URI.

---

# Updated Working Connection String

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://username:password@ac-xxxxx-shard-00-00.mongodb.net:27017,ac-xxxxx-shard-00-01.mongodb.net:27017,ac-xxxxx-shard-00-02.mongodb.net:27017/weatherDB?ssl=true&replicaSet=atlas-xxxxx-shard-0&authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

---

# Additional Fixes Applied

* Added IP Address:

```text
0.0.0.0/0
```

inside:

```text
Security → Network Access
```

* Restarted backend server after updating `.env`

* Verified MongoDB connection using:

```bash
node server.js
```

---

# Successful Output

```text
MongoDB Connected Successfully
Server running on port 3000
```

---

# Learning Outcome

This issue helped in understanding:

* MongoDB Atlas connectivity
* DNS SRV resolution
* Difference between `mongodb+srv://` and `mongodb://`
* Network-related backend debugging
* Real-world troubleshooting during backend setup


---

# OpenWeather API Setup

## Step 1 — Create OpenWeather Account

Visit:
https://openweathermap.org/api

Create a free account.

---

## Step 2 — Generate API Key

Navigate to:

```text id="yzdz5l"
My API Keys
```

Generate an API key.

Example:

```text id="x3w9ot"
abcd1234xyz
```

---

# Environment Variable Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

Example:

```env id="3w8g3w"
PORT=3000

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
```

---

# Installation & Setup

## Clone Repository

```bash id="vq8e3q"
git clone <your-github-repository-url>
```

---

## Navigate Into Project

```bash id="ux5g4g"
cd weather-api
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash id="7e7d0g"
npm install
```

---

# Required Dependencies

```bash id="pdv8l0"
npm install express mongoose axios dotenv morgan cors
```

---

# Running The Application

Start backend server:

```bash id="8z5j8s"
node server.js
```

Expected Output:

```text id="q3qclm"
Server running on port 3000
MongoDB Connected Successfully
```

---

# Logging

The application uses Morgan middleware for request logging.

Installed using:

```bash id="mf6k8e"
npm install morgan
```

Example logs:

```text id="cpb4ah"
GET /weather 200 10ms
POST /weather 201 18ms
DELETE /weather/6868xxxx 200 12ms
```

Logging helps:

* Monitor API activity
* Debug issues
* Track backend requests
* Improve observability

---

# Validation

The backend validates incoming request data before database operations.

Example:

```javascript id="g4q8ur"
if (!city || !temperature || !weather) {
   return res.status(400).json({
      error: "All fields are required"
   });
}
```

---

# Error Handling

The application uses try-catch blocks to handle runtime and database errors.

Example:

```javascript id="axr8q3"
try {

   // operation

} catch(error) {

   res.status(500).json({
      error: "Server Error"
   });

}
```

---

* Postman
* Thunder Client
* Hoppscotch

For POST and PUT requests:
Use:

```text id="8tfq53"
